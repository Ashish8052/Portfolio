            <p style="width: 50%; margin: auto;">Narendra Damodardas Modi, He is 14th prime minister of India and a great leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), assumed charge as PM for a second term on May 30, 2019. This was after their party won a decisive mandate in Lok Sabha elections (2019). Of the 542 Lok Sabha constituencies that went to the polls in seven phases from April 11 to May 19, 2019, the BJP won 303 seats on its own. The National Democratic Alliance, the alliance of parties the BJP led, won a massive tally of 351 seats.

                In his second term in office, Prime Minister Modi has additional charge of the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Department of Atomic Energy, Department of Space, besides all other portfolios not allocated to any other minister.
                 
                Born in Gujarat's Vadnagar in 1950, Modi is said to have spent his early childhood working in his family tea stall and also selling tea at railway platforms. While Modi was introduced to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) at the age of 8, he joined BJP in the year 1987. His party won a majority in Gujarat in 1995 and Modi quickly rose up the ranks. His humble origins captured the minds of Indians who felt they could connect with him.
                 
                Narendra Modi had his first brush with a government in 2001, when the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Keshubhai Patel stepped down as Gujarat chief minister in the wake of the Bhuj earthquake that killed thousands of people. Modi was selected as Patel’s replacement and remained in power in the state until May 22, till 2014. As the state’s chief minister, he was credited with leading development activities in Gujarat. However, a low point for the state government came in 2002, when critics accused it of not doing enough to stem the 2002 riots that killed at least 1,000 people. In 2013, Modi was chosen as the BJP's prime ministerial candidate for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Under his leadership, the party won the 2014 elections with a thumping majority, on the back of a so-called ‘Modi wave’ and capitalising on the popular discontent against the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, which had been mired in controversies following several scams and charges of impropriety against some of its leaders.
                 
                Modi had contested the 2014 polls from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh and Vadodara in Gujarat. He won both these Lok Sabha constituencies and was appointed the prime minister on May 26, 2014. Since an MP cannot represent more than one constituency according to the law, he vacated the Vadodara seat.In 2019, he again contested from Varanasi and registered an even bigger victory than in 2014. He defeated his nearest rival, the Mahagathbandhan's Shalini Yadav, by a margin of 479505 votes.  
                 
                Known to be a tech-savvy politician, Modi is an avid Twitter user.
